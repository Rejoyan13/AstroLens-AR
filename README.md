# AstroLens-AR
AstroLens AR is a Unity-based AR mobile application that uses marker-based image detection to visualize 3D planets. By scanning planet images from a custom-designed book, users can explore interactive 3D models with zoom, rotation, and detailed information in an engaging augmented reality experience.
# 🌌 AstroLens AR

AstroLens AR is an augmented reality (AR) based mobile application developed using **Unity**.  
The app is designed to enhance learning about the solar system by allowing users to visualize **3D planets** through **marker-based image detection**.

By scanning images of planets from a specially designed book, users can interact with realistic 3D models in real time.
